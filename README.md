## Design Decisions
- Why did we choose this theme?
    - Provide a game that gives an out-of-this-world experience.
- Why did we implement multiple genres?
    - Different levels were based on different genres to provide a diverse gaming experience, thus catering to a wider audience. The variety of genres provides challenges that target different skill sets of the player.
