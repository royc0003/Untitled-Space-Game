# Untitled-Space-Game
Traverse through the different levels as you try to find your way back to Earth after being abducted by aliens! Test your skills by completing puzzles, navigating obstacles, and overcoming various other challenges that await you.\
Designed using: `Unity3D`

## Design Decisions
- Why did we choose this theme?
    - Provide a game that gives an out-of-this-world experience.
- Why did we implement multiple genres?
    - Different levels were based on different genres to provide a diverse gaming experience, thus catering to a wider audience. The variety of genres provides challenges that target different skill sets of the player.

## The Storyline (Briefly)
After getting abducted by a UFO, the main character realizes he is in a strange laboratory room.\

`Level 1`:\
Navigate through the different floors of the alienâ€™s hideout to find a way to escape.\

`Level 2`:\
After escaping the hideout, get to the other side and reunite with his comrade by avoiding obstacles, and killing or avoiding enemies that are in the way.\

`Level 3`:\
Retrieve fuel by solving a memory grid and shooting aliens in a color pattern.\

`Level 4`:\
After getting fuel, the main character and his comrade realizes the rocket can only fit one person. The comrade reveals his evil intentions and becomes a giant that the main character has to defeat by shooting.\

`Ending`:\
The main character flew the rocket and managed to land safely back on Earth. He documents his adventures into a game called Untitled Space Game.
